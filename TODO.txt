	cleaning, tweaking, understanding... So I come up with this TODO:
	
	* Determining if a neutral conductor is current-carrying is wrong. To fix:
		* Conductors.java line 71
		* BaseLoad.java, line 122
		* GenericLoad.java, line 223

		The method isNeutralPossiblyCurrentCarrying() in VoltageAC.java, line 278, should be used to determine if the neutral is (possibly) a CC conductor.
		(this method should/could be renamed as isSystemNeutralCurrentCarrying() --> better keep it as is because it shows that further consideration is needed at the load level (if load is non linear)

		Here is the rule for non current-carryng (the system must have a neutral)
			- All loads fed from a 3φ Y system (they all are 4 wires, 3 hots + neutral)
			- All loads fed from a 1φ E system (2 hots + neutral, 3 wires)
			The system must:
				- have a neutral AND either:
					- be 3φ, WYE
					- be E

		All others are cc if neutral is present.

Conduct the test making the default edition to NEC2017 in the file NECEdition.java

Notes about the edtools project.
11/19/2023.

After a pause since december 2021, I am retaking this project.
When reviewing it, I realized that the KISS principle was not applied. My library is way too complicated.

The result messages is super complicated and probably not that useful. There are so many errors accounted for, probably
because there are many ways to make mistakes and get an error. This is specially true for null variables.

So, to reduce this, I need to reduce the null values by using @NonNull annotation to implement non nullables variables.

5/19/24: OR to start using the Kotlin language. In general, whenever I can, I will be porting everything to Kotlin.


To do:

ALWAYS IMPLEMENT A TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT APPROACH!!!!!!!!!

*1. Make a copy of edtools
*2. Find the non-core classes and rename them to *.txt
*3. Start working with the core classes.
	Review one by one. Check compatibility with the NEC 2014, 2017 and 2020. Some methods are NEC independent, while
	others are not. The latter must be annotated and tested for each code version. Refactor as necessary.

			Using the NEC annotation:
			If a method depends on changes of the NEC, it shall be annotated to indicate that it has been revised and
			tested to comply with the annotated code editions. For example:
				@NEC(year = "2014")
            	@NEC(year = "2017")
            	@NEC(year = "2020")
            	public double getCorrectionFactor()

            This annotation means that this method can be used for any edition of the code, as annotated.
            All methods in this software should run properly for these three editions of the NEC. To test, what if the
            edition used in the software use this:
            if (NECEdition.getDefault() == NECEdition.NEC2014)
                runTheMethodFor2014Edition()
            else if (NECEdition.getDefault() == NECEdition.NEC2017)
                runTheMethodFor2017Edition()

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I have tried to do so far, converting my classes to immutable ones have been crap. After watching a lot of videos I
trusted immutability so much that I went closed eyes to recode everything. In the beginning I was optimistic but the
more I recoded the more the challenges I was facing. After a lot of time coding, deleting, recoding, starting-over, I
have come across the conclusion that immutability is good, but it's not the rule. People tend to speak about it as if it was a
religion.
So, I'm writing now the principles under which I am going to refactor this piece of software. My main goal is to keep
everything simple (KISS principle). The following might be seen as the architecture for this code but is also applicable
to other programs.

Mutable objects are necessary. When used appropriately they result in code that is clear and simple. But, it is not
easy to use them correctly, a lot of planning, thinking and discipline are necessary. What is important, is to keep in
mind at all times, how to avoid side effects. Here is my strategy/architecture:

1. Objects use objects.
A class can have private field object that the class uses "privately". There are two scenarios:
	1.1. The class does not expose the object to the exterior. There is no getter. In that case, the object can be
	mutable and the class can handle the change of state for that single object. The class consumes behavior and state
	from this object. For example a private-no-getter-field object TList.
	The bad thing about this, is that the class depends on this private object. So, if the object is not going to change
	 with time (because it is not prone to be change), go ahead and use it. But, if this object is under development,
	 that is, prone to changes, specially if it is made by a third party, the best thing to do is that the field is
	 coupled to an interface, not to the implementation. Any object that implements that interface can be used without
	 changing the internals of the class.
	1.2. The class exposes the object to the exterior. There are three scenarios here:
		1.2.1. The getter to the object returns a copy of the object. Any change to that object outside the class
		will not affect the container class.
		1.2.2. The getter returns a read-only interface to that object, so the exterior can read the state of the object
		but cannot make changes. This is achieved by placing all the getters in an interface. For example, a class Point
		might have getters and setters. So we make the class Point to implement ROPoint (or ImmutablePoint), and we move
		all the getter definitions to the interface ROPoint.
		1.2.3. The getter returns the object reference. THERE WILL BE SIDE EFFECTS!. This is what I think the cult of
		anti-mutability fears of. Well, this scenario is needed for GUI interfaces where you want your GUI to update
		once you change something somewhere (however, you could use an MVC architecture to separate
		concerns/responsibilities). For other cases, we need to avoid exposing object references. However, if you really
		need to expose that object you can do two things to keep control over your code:
			- Use listeners: this adds a lot of complexity.
			- Do not trust that object. That is, everytime your class is requested to provide state (which happens
			through getters), your class must assume that the object has changed. That is, recompute your state
			everytime it is requested and provide all the class state at once (we do not want the state to change in
			between calls to getters, since the value obtained from one getter might be not compatible with the value
			returned by another getter later in the code, so the state must be picked all at once).
		In general, the change of state in a class should be done through the class, by calling setters of behavioral
		methods, but never getters!!!

2. A container class is passed an external object.
A class manages a list of objects. Every object is added in bulk or one by one. The class has the methods "add" and
"remove". There are two cases:
	2.1. We do not need to change the state of the owned objects. In that case the objects can be immutable or be
	represented by an immutable interface.
	2.2. We need to change the state of the owned objects. How do we know this object is not being used by another
	object that also can change its state? There are two approaches:
		2.2.1. The "add" method makes a copy of the passed object.
		2.2.2. The object has a field that references the container class. So, the "add" method checks if the passed
		object has that field null before actually adding it to the list. If that field is not null there can be two
		scenarios:
			2.2.2.1. The "add" method throws an exception if the object is owned by another object. That is, we do not
			want to change this object and produce a side effect in the other container. This is the best approach.
			2.2.2.2. The "add" method detach the object from its container by calling
			myObject.getContainer().remove(myObject). Of course, this produces side effect in the other container that
			in some cases might be desired. In other circumstances, do not use this approach.

3. Strategies applicable only to this software:
*-ResultMessage is immutable.
*-ResultMessages is mutable and has a RO interface. When returning the actual list of errors, it returns a copy.
*-VoltageDropAC and DC are mutable.
*-Conductor is mutable and implements Conduitable which is readonly.
*-If a conductor is set its ambient temperature: if its conduit or bundle property is null the temperature is set.
Otherwise, it rises an exception, because the conductor belongs to a conduit or to a bundle and only those objects can
assign the ambient temperature of the owned conductors.

-Any object using/consuming an external Conductor must be passed a Conduitable.
-Conduit is mutable, but its conductors and cables are exposed as Conduitables (as immutable objects). When adding a
conductor to a conduit if the conductor's conduit field is not null and not the same as the conduit that is adding it,
it must throw an exception.
-Conduit must have a method to set the ambient temperature of all its conductors. all conductors added to the conduit
are set the same ambient temperature of the conduit.
-The circuitAll class must not change the ambient temperature of an external conduit.

//////to be reviewed later - IS THIS NECESSARY?//////
JSON representation of objects.
-------------------------------
The JSON representation of any object must have enough detail to:
- Recreate the object from scratch.
- Represent the object state in the front-end side.

 The challenge arises when representing objects that contain objects, where the child objects reference the parent
 object. In this case, the children should not add the parent object to their JSON representation, otherwise an infinite
 reference loop is created. For this software.


1. Objects that perform calculations:
	- The ResultMessage object is added first, since it contains the result messages of the class level, before any
	calculation is requested.
	- Then, param fields are added. Param fields are private fields that have setters and getters or that are set during
	 construction.
	- If a calculating method can add result messages to the ResultMessage list, then, a 2dn level objects is created
	to contain the calculated values and their result messages. The name of the object is the name of the calculating
	method without the "get" prefix. The result is stored as "value".
	- If the calculating method does not change the result message list, then the result value is added as a field (not
	wrapped in an object)
	- Fields referencing other objects are not added.

--------------------------------------------------
Progress list (updated on 11/26/2021)
*- ResultMessage: ok.
*- ResultMessages: ok. No context was implemented.
*- VoltageDropAC: updated. all tests run fine.
*- VoltageDropDC: updated. all tests run fine.
- Conductor: APPROACH #2 was implemented. Update 1/1/2024: None of these approaches are in place now. Instead, class Conductor has the method setConduit declared as public. This method checks that the caller is a Conduit object by using "Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace()[2].getClassName()"
	- Interaction with the Conduit and the Bundle classes:
	  The methods getAdjustmentFactor() and getCorrectionFactor need to know the conduit the conductor belongs to.
	  The methods getAdjustmentFactor() needs to know the bundle the conductor belongs to.
	  The class Conduit has the method add(Conduitable) which add the conductor to an internal list of conductors.
	  Somehow, after calling Conduit.add() the conductor must have a reference to the conduit it belongs to.
	  There are three approaches:
	  1. The Conduit class maintain a static list of created conduits. When a conductor needs to know if it belongs to a
	   conduit, the conductor calls Conduit.getConduitFor(this). Basically the conductor asks the Conduit class which
	   conduit contains it. This is the actual implementation. The disadvantage of this is that the static list of
	   conduits only grows. There is no way to take an unused conduit out that list. That means that the conduit object
	   will never be garbage collected since there will be at list one reference to each created conduit. A way to solve
	   this is to clear the list after we do not need any of these conduits, like after responding to a http request.
	   But that call might be implicit. In a standalone app the list is empty once a new project is created for example.
	  2. Put the Conduit, the Bundle, the Conductor and the Cable class in a separate package and make the methods
	  Conductor.setConduit() package accessible only. The separate package could be conductors.raceways.
	  3. The Conductor class has the method addConduit(Conduit). The disadvantage is that this method is public but
	  should not be called by anyone except the class Conduit. To solve this, the class conduit has two private fields:
	  boolean addingConductor and conductorBeingAdded. Right before the conduit.Add(Conductor) is called, these two
	  fields are set to true and to the conductor object about to be added. When the method Conductor.addConduit
	  (Conduit) is called the conductor calls back the method Conduit.checkIsAdding(this); like this:

	  in the class Conduit:
	  void add(Conductor conductor){
	    addingConductor = true;
	    conductorBeingAdded = conductor;
	    conductor.setConduit(this);
	    addingConductor = false;
        conductorBeingAdded = null;
	  }

	  boolean checkIsAdding(Conductor conductor){
	    return (addingConductor && conductor == conductorBeingAdded)
	  }

	  in the class Conductor:
	  void setConduit(Conduit conduit){
	    if(!conduit.checkIsAdding(this)
	      throws new Exception("This method cannot be called from outside a conduit object. or something like that")
	    this.conduit = conduit.
	  }


For conductor:
*-javadoc
*-flush comments.
*-run test with coverage. Done.
*-correct usage of errors #57, 59 & 61.
*-implement toJSON or check the default conversion works (especially when using ResultMessages).
*-Add a test case to test the result messages for full coverage.

For cable:
*-javadoc
*-flush comments.
*-run test with coverage.
*-implement toJSON or check the default conversion works (especially when using ResultMessages).
*-Add a test case to test the result messages for full coverage.
*-solve dilemmas.

For conduit:
/*quedé aquí:
-javadoc
-flush comments.
-run test with coverage.
-implement toJSON or check the default conversion works (especially when using ResultMessages).
-Add a test case to test the result messages for full coverage.

Do the same for:
	-VoltageDropAC
	-VoltageDropDC
	-OCPD
	-the classes in package loads
	-all the other classes, except Circuit,


-Continue with next step in CircuitTest.java which should be more tests in class
 Circuit (copying from the old CircuitTest.java.txt)
-Once CircuitTest is completed, do:
	-javadoc
	-flush comments.
	-run test with coverage.
	-implement toJSON or check the default conversion works (especially when using ResultMessages).
	-Add a test case to test the result messages for full coverage.

-Implement ACMotorTest from the ACMotorTest.java.txt
-Add more load types
-Implement panels
-Plan for beyond.

///////everything down from here is deprecated///////////////////////////

Applying this architecture to all classes:
- VoltageDropAC (mutable, builder) todo: make it mutable
- VoltageDropDC (immutable, builder)
- ResultMessage (immutable)
- ResultMessages (mutable, implements an immutable interface)
- Conductor (mutable, implements the immutable interface Conduitable)
- Cable (mutable except for system voltage, implements the immutable interface Conduitable)
- Conduit (mutable except for ambient temperature)
- Bundle (mutable except for ambient temperature)
- Circuit (mutable, except for system voltage, internal or external conduit, internal or external bundle, if is on free
air or not)


Todo:
1. There should not be setters for parameters that are passed in the constructors. Those parameters are meant to make
that object immutable in regard to those parameters.

2. The ResultMessages should ONLY contain errors and warnings that occur after the object is constructed. Any error
occurring during construction MUST throw an IllegalArgumentException. When used in a REST API that error must be
captured and sent back to client. Errors occurring due to a "presupposition failure" must also throw exceptions. For
example, trying to set a property of the neutral conductor of a cable that does not have a cable should throw an
exception. All other errors occurring during a call to a setter or when computing a value, must be put inside the
ResultMessage object.

3. Make VoltageDropAC 100% mutable with no constructors. It should not use the Conductor class. All setters should be
chainable. Each result is compute in real time, accounting for the actual values of all its parameters.

4. Consider creating a CircuitPhaseConductor interface to return a conductor representing the phase conductors. Through
this interface certain changes can be done. Same for a CircuitNeutralConductor, but limiting even more the access to
certain setters. Same for CircuitGroundingConductor. What about cables?






















2. Start making the classes immutable; do it by package basis. The class needs to be tested for converting it to a JSON
string, and then recreating the class from a JSON string

	✓a. voltagedrop ac and dc. DONE
	b. ResultMessages
	b. conduits
	c. conductors.
	d. loads.
	e. circuits.

3. Refactoring of classes:
	0. Commit.
	a. Create a copy of the class with an old_ prefix name.
	b. Make the changes to the existing class.
	c. run tests
	d. make changes to the classes using this class.
	e. commit.

ResultMessages
This class is used as composition by other classes. ResultMessages is a container and so it is
mutable. The owner class can add or remove messages from it. However, the owner class returns a
ROResultMessages which does not have any setter and as such the container cannot be changed.
It only has getters. One of the getters returns a list of ResultMessage objects. The ROResultMessage
class is completely immutable, but it's a fake immutability.
It will be converted to immutable completely, by adding a builder class that:
- has the two variants of the add method.


Bundle
This class is a container of conduitables. It will be transformed into an immutable class.
Originally it has these methods:
==to be passed in a Builder==
- add(Conduitable) -> List<Conduitable>
- setBundlingLength(double)

==to be deleted==
- remove(Conduitable)
- empty()
- NotifierDelegate getNotifier()

==to be kept==
boolean isEmpty()
boolean hasConduitable(Conduitable)
int getCurrentCarryingCount()
int getConductorCount()
boolean complyWith310_15_B_3_a_4()
boolean complyWith310_15_B_3_a_5()
double getBundlingLength()
List<Conduitables> getConduitables() -> returning

Design architecture:************************************************************
0. All classes must be immutable.
1. The calculator class must implement the Builder pattern when the number of
   parameters is four or more. For up to three parameters, the class will use
   a constructor.
