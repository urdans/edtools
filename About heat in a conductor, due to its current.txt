What is the best equation to express the temperature of a conductor due to its current?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The temperature of a conductor due to its current can be expressed using Joule's law, which states that the heat generated (Q) in a conductor is proportional to the square of the current (I) flowing through it, the resistance (R) of the conductor, and the time (t) during which the current flows. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

Q = I^2 R t

The temperature rise (ΔT) of the conductor due to the generated heat can be calculated using the specific heat capacity (c) of the conduitMaterial of the conductor and its mass per unit length (m). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

ΔT = Q / (c * m)

Therefore, the best equation to express the temperature of a conductor due to its current is:

ΔT = I^2 R t / (c * m)

=============================================================================================================================
what is the heat capacity of copper?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The specific heat capacity of copper is approximately 0.385 J/g*K at room temperature, where J represents Joules, g represents grams, and K represents Kelvin. This means that it takes 0.385 Joules of energy to raise the temperature of 1 gram of copper by 1 degree Kelvin.

=============================================================================================================================
what is the resistivity of copper?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The resistivity of copper is approximately 1.68 x 10^-8 ohm-meters at 20°C. This value can vary slightly depending on the purity and temperature of the copper. Copper is a highly conductive conduitMaterial and is commonly used in electrical wiring and other applications where high conductivity is required.

Deduct the formula for the change in temperature of a copper wire, given its length, diameter and current flowing through it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The change in temperature of a copper wire due to the current flowing through it can be calculated using the following formula:

ΔT = (I^2 * R * t) / (m * c)

where:

    ΔT is the change in temperature of the copper wire in degrees Celsius (°C)
    I is the current flowing through the wire in amperes (A)
    R is the resistance of the wire in ohms (Ω)
    t is the time during which the current flows through the wire in seconds (s)
    m is the mass of the wire in kilograms (kg)
    c is the specific heat capacity of copper in joules per kilogram per degree Celsius (J/kg°C)

The resistance of the wire can be calculated using the following formula:

R = (ρ * L) / A

where:

    ρ is the resistivity of copper in ohm-meters (Ωm)
    L is the length of the wire in meters (m)
    A is the cross-sectional area of the wire in square meters (m^2)

The mass of the wire can be calculated using the following formula:

m = ρ * V

where:

    V is the volume of the wire in cubic meters (m^3)

The volume of the wire can be calculated using the following formula:

V = π * (d/2)^2 * L

where:

    d is the diameter of the wire in meters (m)

By substituting the expressions for R, m and V in the initial formula for ΔT, we obtain the following formula for the change in temperature of a copper wire:

ΔT = (I^2 * ρ * L * t * π * (d/2)^2) / (ρ * π * (d/2)^2 * L * c)

Simplifying and canceling out common terms, we get:

ΔT = (I^2 * ρ * t) / (c * A)

where:

    A = π * (d/2)^2 is the cross-sectional area of the wire in square meters (m^2)

Therefore, the formula for the change in temperature of a copper wire, given its length, diameter and current flowing through it, is:

ΔT = (I^2 * ρ * t) / (c * π * (d/2)^2)
=============================================================================================================================
Simplify that formula by using the actual values of ρ, c, and π.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, the actual values of the resistivity of copper (ρ) and the specific heat capacity of copper (c) are approximately:

ρ = 1.68 x 10^-8 ohm-meters

c = 385 J/kg*K

π is a mathematical constant with an approximate value of 3.14159.

Substituting these values in the formula for ΔT we obtained earlier, we get:

ΔT = (I^2 * 1.68 x 10^-8 * t) / (385 * 3.14159 * (d/2)^2)

Simplifying further, we can express π * (d/2)^2 as (0.25πd^2), so we have:

ΔT = (I^2 * 1.68 x 10^-8 * t) / (96.52 * d^2)

Therefore, the simplified formula for the change in temperature of a copper wire, given its length, diameter, and current flowing through it is:

ΔT = (1.738 x 10^-10 * I^2 * t) / d^2

where:

    ΔT is the change in temperature of the copper wire in degrees Celsius (°C)
    I is the current flowing through the wire in amperes (A)
    t is the time during which the current flows through the wire in seconds (s)
    d is the diameter of the wire in meters (m)

=============================================================================================================================
Simplify this formula for a copper wire size 12 AWG.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To simplify the formula for a copper wire size 12 AWG, we need to know the diameter of this wire.

The diameter of a 12 AWG wire is approximately 0.0808 inches or 2.053 mm.

Converting the diameter to meters, we have:

d = 2.053 x 10^-3 meters

Substituting this value of d into the simplified formula we derived earlier, we get:

ΔT = (1.738 x 10^-10 * I^2 * t) / (2.053 x 10^-3)^2

Simplifying further, we have:

ΔT = (1.738 x 10^-10 * I^2 * t) / 4.214 x 10^-6

Therefore, the simplified formula for the change in temperature of a copper wire size 12 AWG, given its current and time of operation is:

ΔT = (0.04124 * I^2 * t)

where:

    ΔT is the change in temperature of the copper wire in degrees Celsius (°C)
    I is the current flowing through the wire in amperes (A)
    t is the time during which the current flows through the wire in seconds (s)

Please note that this formula assumes uniform heat dissipation along the wire and does not account for any heat loss due to convection or radiation.

    10 AWG: 0.02655
    8 AWG: 0.01684
    6 AWG: 0.01062
    4 AWG: 0.006676

    2/0 AWG: 0.001982
    3/0 AWG: 0.001571
    4/0 AWG: 0.001245

Therefore, for a copper wire of a specific size, you can use the formula:

ΔT = (constant term * I^2 * t)

where the constant term is calculated based on the diameter of the wire, as shown above, and:

    ΔT is the change in temperature of the copper wire in degrees Celsius (°C)
    I is the current flowing through the wire in amperes (A)
    t is the time during which the current flows through the wire in seconds (s)

Again, please note that this formula assumes uniform heat dissipation along the wire and does not account for any heat loss due to convection or radiation.
